# DailyCrystal

This Spigot plugin shows a special crystal only to who hasn't reedemed it yet,
daily.

It has streak and notification support and everything, including strings, is
configurable in its respective file.

There's only one command, `dailycrystal`, executable with the
`dailycrystal.command.dailycrystal` permission with two sub-commands:

 - `reload`, executable with the `dailycrystal.command.dailycrystal.reload`
pemission, which allows to reload the plugin's configuration, player data and
strings;

 - `notification <enable/disable>`, which allows the user to choose whether or
not to receive a custom title reminding them to redeem their daily reward.

As this plugin derives from bukkit code it is licensed under the GNU General
Public License v3.0.

Any contribution or suggestion is welcome!
